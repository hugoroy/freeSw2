Issue: the original page is published with a license not allowing modifications. I *assume* that the license refers to the full text of the article and not to all style elements from GNU.org -- this project is only an attempt to re-style the “What is Free Software?” page so that it could appeal to a broader audience.

To deploy you need https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/, for instance:

   git submodule add https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/ 

To build, simply use Less:

   lessc style.less -x style.min.css

Note: I'm not a real web designer. If you're interested in doing this, please do it better :-)
